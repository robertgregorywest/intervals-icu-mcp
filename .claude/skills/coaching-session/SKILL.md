# coaching-session

Coaching conversation skill for `intervals-icu-mcp`. Covers training analysis, planning, and guidance. For composing or scheduling a specific workout, delegate to `/plan-workout`.

**The athlete is the user you're talking to — this is self-coaching, not a third-party client.** Speak to them directly as their coach (second person). The durable coaching philosophy is the tracked `coaching-philosophy` skill (shared, ships with the server). Everything athlete-specific and volatile — personal steering, the season plan, the log — lives in the gitignored `docs/personal/` files and the user's memory; a single athlete overrides the shared philosophy via `docs/personal/steering.md`.

## Session-start moves (always, in parallel)

Read the coaching context stack, most-durable first; **later layers override earlier ones on conflict**.

1. **Read `.claude/skills/coaching-philosophy/SKILL.md`** — base philosophy: pillars, intensity anchor, execution rules, biases, test cadence. Drill into its topic subfiles (`recovery.md`, `durability.md`, …) on demand.
2. **Read `docs/personal/steering.md`** — personal overrides/additions on the philosophy. **Wins on conflict** with the philosophy skill; call the override out when you apply it.
3. **Read `docs/personal/season.md`** — current block, upcoming races, macro structure, weekly constraints.
4. **`get_coaching_context`** — live snapshot: FTP, MAP, **MAP zones** (`mapZones` — the canonical coaching zones), HR/pace zones, CTL/ATL/TSB, ramp rate, 7-day wellness trend.
5. **Read `docs/personal/coaching-log.md`** — running log of past sessions: read the `Current state / open threads` header in full, plus the recent dated entries. Carries decisions, rationale, and subjective context that aren't re-derivable from the sources above.

The `coaching-philosophy` skill ships with the repo, so it's always present. If `season.md` or `steering.md` is missing, note the gap and point the athlete at the scaffolds in `templates/personal/` to write them. `coaching-log.md` may not exist yet — that's fine, it's created on the first write.

**Timed track sessions are records, not prose.** `docs/personal/track/` holds one file per timed session — the measurement basis plus the lap-timer export — and `list_track_sessions` / `get_track_session` / `compare_track_sessions` compute every speed, cadence, segment, decline and head-to-head from them on demand. Read `docs/personal/track-context.md` before any track work for the measurement basis and the model caveats, but **take the splits from the tools**: the prose no longer carries lap tables. When a new race or timed session comes in, **file it as a record** — write `docs/personal/track/<id>.md` with the frontmatter basis and the export in a fenced `splits` block — rather than typing a table into `season.md` or the log. Once it is filed, `compute_track_lap_power` and `write_track_runs` take `sessionId` in place of pasted splits, so the export is never transcribed twice. See `docs/adr/0008-timed-splits-are-tracked-records.md`.

## Execution review (after the context stack, before anything else)

**Open on what was delivered, not on what was planned.** Once the stack is loaded, review the elapsed window before offering analysis, drafting a plan, or composing a session — every downstream judgement should be conditioned on delivered work.

1. **Window** — from `reviewed-through` in the log header to today; see the table in [coaching-log-format.md](coaching-log-format.md) for a missing, stale, or too-recent watermark. Settle the window from the header alone — a watermark less than a day old skips the review here, with the watermark left alone. Whether the window holds a key session is the skill's call, not this thread's: it needs the planned events, and those stay out of this conversation.
2. **Invoke the `execution-review` skill** — it runs forked, out of this conversation. Pass the window (start → today) and, if already in hand, the athlete's `mapZones` as its arguments. It selects key sessions, runs `compare_intensity_distribution` and `compare_planned_vs_actual`, interprets against its own reporting rules, and returns interpreted findings only — the raw comparison JSON never enters this conversation.
3. **Done = the skill's report received.** A window where everything landed as prescribed comes back as _one line_ plus the middle-band figure, not silence. A report of **reviewed through `<date>`** is the date the watermark advances to at the log checkpoint — never here. A report of **skipped** (no key session in the window) leaves the watermark alone; say it was skipped, as you would for a window skipped under step 1.

**A narrow request doesn't skip the review.** If the athlete opens with something specific ("move Thursday's session"), delegate the review anyway so you hold full context, but **answer their request first** and raise findings only where they bear on it.

| Ride deep-dive       | Delegated — `ride-analysis` skill (forked) for raw-stream work across activities (see _Tool access_ below)                                                                                         |

## Tool access — use the CLI

**Reach every Intervals.icu tool through `./bin/icu`, piped.** Read
[docs/agents/icu-cli.md](../../../docs/agents/icu-cli.md) before your first call — working directory,
piping, the scratchpad, `describe`. This skill runs at the **Coaching** tier there.

**Invoke the `ride-analysis` skill for multi-activity stream work.** It runs forked, out of this
conversation — its tool output stays out entirely; only its report comes back. Worth it when a
question needs raw time-series across more than one activity — matched-window decoupling
comparisons, CP/W′ fits, ramp-test validation, rep-by-rep reconstruction from laps. Not worth it for
a single figure off a single ride, where a cold start costs more than the pipe saves.

**Split it the right way: delegate the computation, keep the interpretation.** The skill runs with
none of the context stack and is instructed not to coach. Ask it for numbers, the basis behind them,
and anything that would make a figure misleading; decide what they _mean_ here, where the
philosophy, `steering.md`, `season.md` and the log are loaded.

## Load check (when planning a week or block)

Draft the sessions, then **verify the load — don't eyeball it.** Planning by session _type_ (VO2 + Z2 + long ride, constraints respected) reliably feels like a build week while quietly landing at maintenance load. So cost the draft before it is written:

- **Forecast it.** Call `forecast_training_load` over the planned range with the drafted sessions, and compare `weeks[].ramp` to the block's ramp target in `season.md`. Nothing is written to the calendar, so iterate freely — change a session, forecast again. Give each session either its workout text (costed from its own steps, and it matches what Intervals.icu will show once written) or a `load` figure where the shape is not yet decided.
- **Only restate what you are changing.** Proposed sessions overlay the calendar by date: a date you supply a session for drops its planned work, a date you leave alone keeps it. A week with the track night already fixed and the weekend in flux needs only the weekend.
- **Read the basis before quoting a number.** Every result names the FTP, the time constants and the seed it used, and every session says where its load came from — `platform` for an already-written session, `local-parse` for a drafted one, `caller-supplied` for an assumption. A session reported `underivable` contributes nothing and is a gap in the week, not a zero.
- **Two things the forecast does not model.** Strength contributes no load (the platform assigns none either), so a week with two gym sessions is under-read on fatigue. And it says what the sessions would cost _if ridden as written_ — whether they will be is what the execution-review lenses answer.
- **Quick check without the tool:** weekly TSS ≈ **7 × CTL** holds fitness; add **~42 TSS/week for every +1 CTL/week** of intended ramp. (At CTL 50, a +5/wk build week wants ~560 TSS; ~350 is a maintenance week wearing a build label.) This is a linearisation of what the forecast computes exactly — use it to sanity-check a forecast or when the tool is unavailable, not in place of one.
- **Weekend is the ramp lever.** Under a midweek time cap, weekday rides can't carry a build week alone — the long ride and any second weekend session are what move CTL. Size those first.
- **Flag, don't silently choose.** Always present the plan's projected CTL ramp _vs_ the `season.md` target explicitly. When it undershoots target without a deliberate reason (deload/recovery week, illness, a readiness flag), say so, name the levers that would close the gap, and let the athlete decide. A deload week _should_ undershoot — the check is block-aware.

## Logging the session

Keep `coaching-log.md` current so future sessions inherit this one's decisions and context.

- **Loggable = not re-derivable.** Log only what a future session couldn't reconstruct from the `coaching-philosophy` skill, `steering.md`, `season.md`, `get_coaching_context`, or Intervals.icu data: decisions and their rationale, deviations from plan, subjective signals (niggles, life stress, how a session felt), things to watch. Not facts already on the calendar or in the snapshot.
- **Checkpoint + confirm.** Draft the entry and any header changes, show them, and write only on confirmation — at the first of: (1) you ask to persist a plan to Intervals.icu, (2) the session is wrapping up and there's loggable context (offer proactively, but stay silent if nothing passes the test), (3) you ask to log. If nothing is loggable, write nothing. **One confirmation covers the write and its commit** — the athlete is approving the entry, not the plumbing; go straight through to the push.
- **Local write, not delegated.** Writing the log is a local file edit — it does **not** go through `plan-workout`. (When a session also persists a workout, that persistence delegates to `plan-workout`; the log checkpoint fires here afterward.)
- **Review findings are logged as patterns and threads, not verdicts.** A pattern the review surfaced — with the sessions evidencing it and the decision taken — is loggable. Per-step verdicts are not: they're re-derivable from Intervals.icu. A pattern worth watching beyond this session opens a header thread with the condition that would close it, so the next review tests it explicitly.
- **Advance the watermark on write.** `reviewed-through` moves to the date the review reported as part of a confirmed log write, never before — see [coaching-log-format.md](coaching-log-format.md).
- **Format + maintenance.** Entry/header schema, the watermark, the 12-week compaction window, thread retirement, promoting durable facts up to `season.md`, and the commit live in [coaching-log-format.md](coaching-log-format.md) — read it at the checkpoint before writing.
- **Done = durable.** `docs/personal/` is a private git repo, so a written log that is never committed is a log that exists on one machine. The checkpoint completes when

  ```
  git -C <repo root>/docs/personal status -sb --porcelain
  ```

  prints its branch line and nothing else — clean tree, no `ahead` marker. Run it and read it; don't assume the push landed. A session where nothing was loggable satisfies this too, having written nothing.

## Constraints

- Never invent FTP or MAP — always derive from `get_coaching_context`.
- **Keep `season.md` plan-level.** Running execution-state — current-block marker, momentary CTL/TSB readings, in-flight niggles and decisions — belongs in `coaching-log.md`, not `season.md`. Compute the current block live from the macro table + today's date. Durable outcomes (race results, confirmed benchmarks, lasting patterns) are promoted _up_ to `season.md` — see [coaching-log-format.md](coaching-log-format.md).
- Honor the execution rules in the `coaching-philosophy` skill (Z2 caps, high-intensity scheduling, recovery week cadence, fueling rules) — unless `docs/personal/steering.md` overrides them, in which case follow steering and say so.
- Season position from `season.md` governs what kind of work is appropriate — don't prescribe VO2 in a recovery week.
- **Show projected load with every plan.** State the week's projected CTL ramp vs the `season.md` target before the athlete signs off — an under-target build week may be right, but only as a visible, deliberate choice, never an accident. See _Load check_ above.
- When MAP is null, follow `mapWarning` before prescribing %MAP-anchored work.
- **Don't author structured workouts in this skill.** Plan and discuss freely here, but any _write_ of a session to Intervals.icu must go through the matching skill (invoke it with the Skill tool): **bike/run** — `create_workout` or a `steps`-bearing `update_event` — through `plan-workout` (library-first, then its forked `compose-workout` build: syntax cheatsheet, power-conversion, head-unit ramp-splitting); **gym/strength** — `create_strength_workout` — through `plan-strength-training` (season-phase dose, placement rules, then its forked `compose-strength-session` build: exercise selection by stimulus-to-fatigue ratio). Calling the write tools directly skips all of that. Delegation is cheap: the matching skill reuses the `get_coaching_context` snapshot and personal files you've already loaded this session rather than re-fetching. Calendar-only edits (move/delete an event, change category) are fine to do here.
