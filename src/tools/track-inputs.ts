/**
 * The inputs `compute_track_lap_power` and `write_track_runs` share.
 *
 * Both tools were written before track session records existed, so both took
 * the lap-timer export pasted as text. That left the export typed twice — once
 * into the record, once into the call — and a second transcription is a second
 * chance to get a digit wrong. `sessionId` closes the loop: the splits come
 * back re-serialised from the record the parser already reconciled, and the
 * activity and lap length come from the same frontmatter.
 *
 * The two shapes are kept in one place because they must not drift: an
 * alignment previewed with `compute_track_lap_power` and then written with
 * `write_track_runs` has to be the same alignment.
