 * One interval as it is *written*, which is a far smaller thing than one as it
 * is read back.
 *
 * Intervals.icu recomputes every metric from the boundaries — power, cadence,
 * heart rate, distance, duration, training load, zone, even weather — so
 * sending any of them is at best noise and at worst a figure that looks
 * authoritative in the request and is silently discarded. Only `start_index`,
 * `end_index` and `label` survive the round trip.
 *
 * `type` is sent for shape and is **not honoured**: an interval sent as
 * `RECOVERY` comes back `WORK`. It is kept here so its absence is never
 * mistaken for an oversight.
 *
 * Boundaries are stream sample indices, end-exclusive: `end_index -
 * start_index` is the interval's sample count, which equals its seconds only
 * on a 1 Hz recording.
