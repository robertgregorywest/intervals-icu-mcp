/**
 * A track session is timed twice over: a helper's lap timer records what
 * happened, and — sometimes — an SRM records what it cost. `track-lap-alignment`
 * owns the join between the two. This module owns the half that survives on its
 * own.
 *
 * A lap time is a measurement. It does not move when MAP moves, when air
 * density moves, or when the aero model is revised, which is what makes it the
 * right thing to keep. So a record stores the timed splits and the basis needed
 * to read them, and **nothing derived** — every speed, cadence, segment and
 * decline below is computed on read.
