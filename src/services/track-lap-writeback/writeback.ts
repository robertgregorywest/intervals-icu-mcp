/**
 * Writing the fitted runs onto the activity.
 *
 * The alignment is reused whole and unchanged — this service adds no fitting.
 * What it adds is the translation into the platform's terms (sample indices, a
 * label, nothing else) and an account of what that translation cost.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately not done here. Metrics are never sent:
 * Intervals.icu recomputes every one of them from the boundaries, so a fitted
 * average power in the request would look authoritative, be silently discarded,
 * and mislead the next reader. And no run is dropped for its verdict: the
 * alignment holds run-level readings robust across the offset interval even
 * where per-lap ones are withheld, so a shaky fit is disclosed — in the label,
 * where it will actually be read — rather than hidden by omission.
