/**
 * Finding the stretches of the activity a run could sit in, and deciding which

 * Both halves exist because of the same failure. Searching the whole activity
 * with the rollout free returns a confident fiction: on the 2026-08-08 session
 * it found a 0.84 rpm residual and a "rollout" of 10.25 m inside a 133 W
 * stretch of easy riding, because near-constant cadence fits any near-constant
 * speed profile once the scale is free. Constraining the search to stretches the
 * athlete was actually riding hard in is what makes the fitted rollout mean
 * something. And matching runs one-to-one in order is what stops two runs of the
 * same distance — runs 3 and 4 differ by 0.6 s over 2 km — from both claiming
