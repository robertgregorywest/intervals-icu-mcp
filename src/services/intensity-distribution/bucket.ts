 * step is inside that window" — and midpoint answers it badly. A `3600s @
 * 200–245 W` endurance block has a midpoint of 222.5 W, one and a half watts
 * inside a band that starts at 220, so midpoint credits the whole hour to the
 * band when a little over half the prescribed range sits below it. Measured
 * against real prescriptions that turned correctly-ridden Z2 sessions into
 * 79% shortfalls and dominated the window aggregate.
 *
 * A range is an acceptable spread, so the honest reading is proportional: if
 * every wattage in 200–245 is acceptable, 56% of what was accepted is in the
 * band. A point target is in or out.
