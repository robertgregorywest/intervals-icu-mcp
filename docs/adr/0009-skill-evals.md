# Skill evals: a custom Agent SDK runner over recorded scenarios

The coaching skills (`coaching-session`, `plan-workout` → `compose-workout`, …) are prompts, and
nothing checked how they behave. We want to score them on realistic moments from the athlete's own
history, sweep **models × effort levels**, and judge a new model against a stored baseline before
switching to it. Issue #20 holds the full design; this records the decisions that shape the code.

## A custom runner on the Agent SDK, not `claude plugin eval`

`claude plugin eval` has no effort flag and no code graders, and its empty-workspace isolation
strips exactly what the skills depend on: the project `.claude/` agents, `docs/personal` and the
`bin/icu` setup. The runner (`evals/skills/run.ts`) instead drives `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
in a throwaway copy of the working tree, with `settingSources: ["project"]` so project skills load
and user-level config does not leak in. Copying the working tree means uncommitted skill edits are
what gets tested — the point of running an eval while editing a skill.

The forked skills' agent definitions pin `model: sonnet`, which would hide the model under test.
The workspace copy rewrites them to `inherit` by default (`--subagent-model pinned` keeps them).

## Replay goes in the CLI

The skills reach Intervals.icu only through `./bin/icu`, so that is the one seam. `src/cassette.ts`
wraps the `HttpClient`'s injectable fetch: `ICU_RECORD_DIR` saves each GET into a cassette,
`ICU_REPLAY_DIR` answers GETs from it and logs misses, and `ICU_RECORD_MISSING` tops a cassette up.
**Writes are never sent in any mode** — they are appended to `ICU_CAPTURE_FILE` and answered with a
synthetic success, so a skill that writes a workout behaves normally and the grader reads the
request it would have made. Recording is therefore safe to run against the live account.

`ICU_NOW` pins "today" through the client facade, and the runner states the scenario date to the
agent, so a replayed scenario is internally consistent. With none of these set, `bin/icu` is
unchanged.

## Deterministic graders first, a judge only for judgement

Graders are TypeScript functions over the transcript, the captured writes and the replay misses.
Anything checkable is checked in code — which skill ran, which writes were made, whether the
written workout parses, whether its work steps sit in the intended watt band. A pinned judge model
(majority of three) covers only the qualitative criteria. `plan-workout`'s 2×20 failure moved from
a judge call to `targetsInBand` for this reason: a code grader cannot be talked round.

`oneWorkoutWritten`, `libraryDecision` and `composeForked`, listed in the issue, did not become
graders of their own. The `writes` grader states the exact calendar writes a run should make.
`skillInvoked` with `skill: compose-workout` checks the fork. Whether the library was used is judged
by the rubric. Two of the issue's graders were renamed when built: `noRawJson` became `noRawDump`,
since it also bounds tables, and `readOnlyRespected` became `cliTier`, with `readOnly` as its
read-only preset. The tiers come from the tool annotations the CLI already enforces, not from a
copied list of command prefixes. `targetsInBand` takes its band from the scenario's `mapZones`, as
the issue intended, and also accepts explicit watts for %FTP prescriptions, which the MAP zones
don't draw.

Each grader declares its options as a zod schema, and `case.yaml` is checked against them when a case
loads, so a misspelt option fails before any money is spent rather than mid-sweep. Graders that
need athlete data (anchors, zones) get it through the same client `bin/icu` uses, replaying the
case's cassette on its scenario date, so they never depend on the cassette's file format.

`--baseline-no-skills` adds the issue's no-skills arm: the same cases with the skills and their
agent types removed, to spot a skill the model no longer needs.

## Scenarios are private; the runner is public

Scenarios carry the athlete's steering, season, coaching log and recorded platform data, so they
live in the private `docs/personal/evals/` (its own repo), along with results. The runner,
graders, capture and compare tools live here. Nothing under `evals/skills` runs in `npm test`,
the husky hook or the release: every trial and judge call costs money, so evals are run by hand,
under a cost ceiling.

## Consequences

- The eval dependencies (`evals/skills/package.json`) stay out of the server's dependency tree, so
  `evals/skills` is type-checked by `npm run eval:typecheck`, not by the hook, which would fail on
  a clone without them installed.
- A skill that reaches Intervals.icu other than through `bin/icu` would escape replay.
- Claude Code's own system prompt carries the real date; the appended scenario date and `ICU_NOW`
  dominate in practice, and the date-bearing graders would show it if they stopped doing so.
- A cassette is a point-in-time recording. A model that asks for data the recording lacks gets a
  replay miss (reported, never scored); `--record-missing` fills the gap from the live account,
  which for a past scenario date is still the same history.
