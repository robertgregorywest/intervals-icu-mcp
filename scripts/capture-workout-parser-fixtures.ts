/**
 * Capture the live oracle for the workout-parser and training-load-forecast
 * services: every planned event that carries Intervals.icu's own parse of its
 * description, alongside the figures the platform derived from that parse.
 *
 * The committed `tests/fixtures/workout-parser/events.json` is the test input,
 * not this script's output path — re-run it deliberately and review the diff,
 * the same way `tests/fixtures/rendered-templates.txt` is refreshed.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/capture-workout-parser-fixtures.ts
 *   npx tsx scripts/capture-workout-parser-fixtures.ts --zones
 *
 * `--zones` additionally refreshes `zone-targets.json`, the oracle for how
 * Intervals.icu resolves a `ZN` target in workout text. There is no read-only
 * route to it — the platform only reveals a resolved target on an event it has
 * parsed — so the flag writes one throwaway event per zone far in the future,
 * reads the figures back, and deletes them. Opt-in, because the default harvest
 * writes nothing.
 *
 * The whole capture is committed, unfiltered. An assertion that needs a
 * threshold must find it in the fixture rather than reaching for live state, so
 * each entry carries `loadBasis` (see below) and its own `ftpUsed`.
