/**
 * The 12 Jul 2026 session, checked against the hand fit `track-context.md` §4
 * records for it.
 *
 * Every other test in this suite locks the tool to its own output on the
 * 2026-08-08 session. This one is the independent check: the per-lap wattages
 * below were derived by hand, before the tool existed, by the method §8
 * describes. A regression that moved the alignment would have to move it in
 * exactly the way a human already arrived at to pass here.
 *
 * It is also a second gear (65×16, 8.526 m/rev, against 64×16 on the other
 * fixture) and a stream with real recording stops in it.
